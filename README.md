## The Perceptron

### Definition
In machine learning, perceptron is an alogrithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by numbers, belongs to some specific class.


The perceptron is a single neuron model with the sign activation function as depicted in the figure below.

## Dataset 

The dataset used is palmerpenguins which contains size measurements for three penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

In this model trained, 'bill_length' and 'bill_depth' are two features used, 'Adelie' and 'Chinstrap' species are treated as label.
